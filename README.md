The purpose  of this repository is to document and save the material coded and developed for the STATS-507 Fall '21 class at the University of Michigan.

In particular the [P2-Q3.py][1] solves the Question 3 of the Problem Set 2.

For that Question is was required to use the data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The dataset is  tabulated and organized to get the variables of interest from the files, ids, age, race, ethnicity, among others. 

Finally, the script reports the number of cases in the data file for the 2011-2018 period.
